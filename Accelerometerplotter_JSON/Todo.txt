Fix phase delay function:
    Calculate frequencies in signal (FFT?)    
    Use multiple methods to calculate phase delay and determine the best one

Use calculated frequency in plot instead of applied frequency

Create tables that summarize characteristics measured from each sweep test

Eliminate outliers 
    Run several tests
        Identify and remove the outlier
        Use the mean of the rest. Maybe other statistical method
        Include standard deviation or other accuracy quantifier?
    Improve reliability of ring placement

Ring IDs
    Pass ring ID when calling the test function and return it as metadata when testing
    Include ring ID in file names

metadata
    Include metadata in the test data instead of sending as a separate topic, preventing mixups

Split python script into multiple files

Save fft plot to a file

sweep is sending test twice
